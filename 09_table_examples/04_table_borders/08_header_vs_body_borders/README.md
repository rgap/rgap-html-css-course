# Header vs Body Borders

This lesson shows how to apply different border styles to the table header and the body.

## What you'll learn

- Styling borders separately for `<thead>` and `<tbody>`.
- How to create a **thicker bottom border** under the header row.
- How to keep the body grid with lighter borders.
- Why visual separation between header and body improves readability.

## Explanation

- Apply a **strong border** to the header to separate it from data rows.
- Apply **lighter borders** to body rows for subtle dividers.
- This is common in professional tables (reports, spreadsheets).

## How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser.  
Youâ€™ll see one table with:

- Thick black border below the header.
- Light gray borders inside the body.

## Notes

- You can also add a top border to the header row for emphasis.
- Works well combined with background colors for the header.
