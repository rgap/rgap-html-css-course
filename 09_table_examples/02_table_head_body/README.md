# Table Head & Body

This lesson introduces two key concepts:

1. **Structure with `<thead>` and `<tbody>`**
   - `<thead>` groups the header rows of a table.
   - `<tbody>` groups the main data rows.
   - `<th>` defines header cells (bold + centered by default).
   - `<td>` defines normal data cells.

## What you'll learn

- Use `<thead>` and `<tbody>` for better structure.
- Difference between `<th>` and `<td>`.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser.  
You’ll see a small product/price table.

## Notes

- Screen readers treat `<th>` as headers and announce them correctly.
- In later lessons we’ll add `<tfoot>` for totals.
- In Lesson 04 we’ll style borders properly with CSS.
