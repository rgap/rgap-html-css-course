# Lesson 01 – Basic Table

This lesson introduces the very foundation of HTML tables.

## What you'll learn

- How to use the `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` elements.
- The difference between **rows** and **cells**.
- How tables are structured in the most minimal form.

## Explanation

- `<table>` defines the whole table.
- `<tr>` means "table row".
- `<td>` means "table data cell".
- Cells are placed _inside_ rows, and rows are placed _inside_ the table.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser.
You should see a 2×2 grid of data without any styling.

## Notes

- By default, HTML tables have invisible borders.
- In later lessons, you’ll learn to add borders, headers, captions, styling, and advanced features.
